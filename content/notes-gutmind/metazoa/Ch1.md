### What it was about

#### PGS's positions on life and mind 

- monism of the mind: biological materialism 
- the arbitrariness of ontological positions of the mind (see panpsychism or materialism) comes from the explanatory gap: it is not satisfactory to explain "what it is like-ness" with matter

#### The question/problem he will tackle

* To solve the explanatory gap by showing how the evolution of living systems can give rise to minds 
* The evolution of subjectivity: what it is and how it came to be
* Transitions in the evolution of the mind. 

#### What stood out for me?

Beautiful quote from Grothendieck (mathematician):

> The sea advances insensibly and in silence, nothing seems to happen and nothing is disturbed... But it finally surrounds the stubborn substance, which little by little becomes a peninsula, then an island, then an islet, which itself becomes submerged, as if dissolved by the ocean stretching away as far as the eye can see. 

"The quote describes his approach to problems in his field. A puzzle in front of us seems to resist the usual methods. What we should do in response is build knowledge around it, expecting that as we do this, the puzzle will transform and disappear. The situation becomes reshaped and eventually comprehensible. The image he used for this process is the submerging of an object, a mass, in water."

... We build around the problem and see it transform and subside. 

Two points. (1) the once explanatory "gap" will no longer be a gap when we transform the problem; (2) this reminds me of the story of Roberta Millstein's life. She told me that she worked around her problem for most of her career instead of directly tackling it. 

#### Action plans and next steps 

Need to read the next chapter to find the arguments I want. Seems promising, though, that it's going to be about sponges.
