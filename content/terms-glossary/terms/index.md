## Free Energy Principle 

"The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) provides an information-theoretic analysis of the concept of existence of self-organising systems (Hohwy, 2020). It entails that self-
organising systems at non-equilibrium steady state bound the entropy of their sensory signals by minimising – on average – a quantity known as variational free energy."
